    <p class="lead text-muted mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
        UVA CS Connect began as a student-led initiative to strengthen the culture of collaboration
        within the Computer Science community at the University of Virginia.
        Our goal is to make connection and opportunity as integral to UVA CS as the classroom experience itself.

                <p class="text-muted fs-5">
                    What started as a small peer-networking group has evolved into a vibrant platform connecting
                    hundreds of UVA CS students across disciplines and career interests.
                    From study groups and technical workshops to mentorship and project teams,
                    CS Connect empowers students to learn collaboratively and apply their skills beyond the classroom.
